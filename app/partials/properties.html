<p>This property is nestled in the heart of the City of Doral. It is prominently located on Doral
Boulevard (NW 41st St) & NW 97th Avenue, midway between the Florida Turnpike and the Palmetto
Expressway (S.R 826). This 35,000 square-foot, L-shaped, single-story shopping center boasts
excellent exposure to NW 41st Street and draws crossover traffic from customers visiting the two
Doral Centre out-parcel stores, Walgreens and McDonald's. It features 237 parking spaces â€“ 6.8
spaces per 1,000 square feet. Anchored by Pediatric Associates, the wide range of service related
businesses at the property appeal to the area's daytime affluent population of 150,000.</p>
